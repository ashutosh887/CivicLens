## 🔧 MCP (Model Context Protocol) - The Killer Feature

MCP is what makes Cline truly powerful. You can create custom tools that Cline can use autonomously!

### How to Create an MCP Server

Simply ask Cline:
```
"Add a tool that fetches government scheme data from data.gov.in API"
```

Cline will automatically:
1. Create the MCP server code
2. Configure it in your settings
3. Make it available for future tasks

### MCP Server Ideas for CivicLens 🏛️

1. **Government Data Fetcher**
   ```
   "Add a tool that fetches scheme eligibility criteria from government APIs"
   ```

2. **Document Parser**
   ```
   "Add a tool that parses PDF documents and extracts eligibility requirements"
   ```

3. **Language Translator**
   ```
   "Add a tool that translates responses to regional Indian languages"
   ```

4. **Database Query Tool**
   ```
   "Add a tool that queries the CivicLens database for common questions"
   ```

5. **Notification Sender**
   ```
   "Add a tool that sends webhook notifications when new schemes are added"
   ```

### MCP Server Template

Here's what an MCP server looks like (Cline creates these for you):

```typescript
// Example: Government Scheme Fetcher MCP Server
import { Server } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";

const server = new Server({
  name: "civiclens-gov-data",
  version: "1.0.0",
}, {
  capabilities: {
    tools: {},
  },
});

server.setRequestHandler("tools/list", async () => ({
  tools: [{
    name: "fetch_scheme_data",
    description: "Fetch government scheme data by category",
    inputSchema: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        category: { type: "string", description: "Scheme category (health, education, pension)" },
        state: { type: "string", description: "Indian state name" }
      },
      required: ["category"]
    }
  }]
}));

// Tool implementation...
```

## ⚡ CLI Workflow Automation

### Autonomous Workflows You Can Build

1. **Continuous Integration Workflow**
   ```
   Ask Cline: "Run tests, fix any failures, and deploy if all pass"
   ```

2. **Database Migration Workflow**
   ```
   Ask Cline: "Create a migration for adding a new 'schemes' table with fields for name, eligibility, and documents"
   ```

3. **API Development Workflow**
   ```
   Ask Cline: "Create a REST API endpoint for /api/schemes that supports filtering by category and state"
   ```

### CLI Commands Cline Handles Well

```bash
# Development
npm run dev                    # Start dev server
npm run build                  # Build for production
npm run lint -- --fix         # Auto-fix linting issues

# Database
npx prisma migrate dev        # Run migrations
npx prisma generate           # Generate client
npx prisma studio             # Open database GUI

# Git Operations
git status && git add . && git commit -m "message"
git push origin main

# Testing
npm test                       # Run test suite
npm run test:coverage         # With coverage report
```

### "Proceed While Running" Feature

For long-running commands like `npm run dev`, Cline can:
- Start the dev server
- Continue working on other files
- React to compilation errors in real-time

## 🧠 Context Management Best Practices

### Using @ Mentions Effectively

| Mention | Use Case | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `@file` | Include specific file | `@app/api/chats/route.ts help me add error handling` |
| `@folder` | Include entire folder | `@components/app fix all TypeScript errors` |
| `@url` | Fetch documentation | `@https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference add proper API routes` |
| `@problems` | Fix workspace issues | `@problems fix all warnings and errors` |

### Context Window Optimization

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "fix the app", say "fix the authentication flow in app/(app)/chats/page.tsx"

2. **Use Checkpoints**: Cline creates snapshots - use "Compare" and "Restore" to test different approaches

3. **Break Down Tasks**: Large tasks should be split:
   ```
   ❌ "Build the entire CivicLens backend"
   ✅ "Create the API endpoint for fetching scheme eligibility"
   ```

### Cline Memory Bank

Create a `.clinerules` file for project-specific instructions:

```markdown
# CivicLens Project Rules

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- Prisma with PostgreSQL
- Clerk for authentication
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow React Server Components best practices
- All API routes should have proper error handling
- Use Zod for input validation

## Project Context
CivicLens helps citizens understand government schemes.
Focus on clarity and accessibility in all responses.
```

## 🌐 Browser Automation

### When to Use Browser Actions

1. **Visual Testing**
   ```
   Ask Cline: "Test the chat interface and verify messages display correctly"
   ```

2. **E2E Testing**
   ```
   Ask Cline: "Test the complete flow: login → ask question → receive answer"
   ```

3. **Screenshot Documentation**
   ```
   Ask Cline: "Take screenshots of all main pages for documentation"
   ```

4. **Debug Runtime Errors**
   ```
   Ask Cline: "Launch the app and check for any console errors"
   ```

### Browser Automation Flow

```
1. Cline runs `npm run dev`
2. Launches headless browser at localhost:3000
3. Performs interactions (click, type, scroll)
4. Captures screenshots and console logs
5. Reports findings and fixes issues
```

---

## 🎯 Advanced Tips & Tricks

### 1. Plan & Act Mode

Switch to **Plan Mode** for complex tasks:
- Discuss approach before coding
- Review architecture decisions
- Get approval before making changes

### 2. YOLO Mode (For Hackathons!)

Enable auto-approve for faster iteration:
- Great for rapid prototyping
- Use with caution in production

### 3. Hooks

Set up hooks for automated actions:
```json
{
  "onSave": "npm run lint",
  "onFileChange": ["*.tsx", "npm run type-check"]
}
```

### 4. Slash Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/new` | Start fresh conversation |
| `/clear` | Clear context |
| `/reportbug` | Report Cline issues |

### 5. Multi-Root Workspace

Cline understands monorepos - organize your hackathon project:
```
civiclens/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/          # Next.js frontend
│   └── api/          # Backend API
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/           # Shared components
│   └── database/     # Prisma schema
└── mcp-servers/      # Custom MCP tools
```

## 🏛️ CivicLens-Specific Ideas

### Autonomous Workflows for Your Hackathon

1. **Auto-Documentation Generator**
   ```
   "Create an MCP tool that generates user documentation from code comments"
   ```

2. **Scheme Data Pipeline**
   ```
   "Build a workflow that:
    1. Scrapes government websites for new schemes
    2. Parses the data
    3. Updates the database
    4. Notifies users of new schemes"
   ```

3. **Multilingual Support**
   ```
   "Add a tool that automatically translates responses to Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, etc."
   ```

4. **Accessibility Checker**
   ```
   "Create a tool that audits pages for WCAG compliance"
   ```

5. **AI Response Validator**
   ```
   "Build a tool that fact-checks AI responses against official government sources"
   ```

### Example Hackathon Submission Flow
